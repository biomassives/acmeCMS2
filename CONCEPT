ACME CMS is a tool to help make it really simple for Academic Departments to publish web pages on their own server.

This code draws from the interface originally used for AcmeCMS at CU Boulder for Engineering Sub-Departments and Centers

Some departments continue to use AcmeCMS, and the goal of this site generator system is to
provide a system with all of the same features, with responsive templating, (twig for next version)
static code isolated from the management database, ease of use on local systems.
